## Description
This was a portfolio I created using a template orginally created by https://github.com/Nazariy995 the idea behind using another software engineers template was to get confident with working with other software engineers code and see how they do things and try to disect the code and make it work for me.
## Installation
you can click on the deployed GH pages link or download the repo and run npm install then run npm start in your VS code. I still have issues with deploying this onto github pages but you can view the portfolio by downloading the repo and running npm install then run npm start in your VS code.
## Usage
This will be used to show prospective employers to showcase my skillset.
